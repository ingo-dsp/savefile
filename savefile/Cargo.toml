[features]
compression = ["bzip2"]

# Enable this to reduce risk of crashing on corrupt input. Provides sanity checks for sizes of objects.
# This is mostly to be able to run fuzzers against the deserializers without them being guaranteed to easily find out-of-memory crashes.
size_sanity_checks = []
# Use features only available on the nightly rust-compiler.
# Enabling this means serialization of vectors of simple types will be much faster.
# It also enables serialization of arbitrary size arrays (arbitrary size Vec always work, regardless of features)
